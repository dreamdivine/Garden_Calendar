    "artichoke": "PREPARING THE GARDEN <br/><br/> The artichoke is a perennial,/ so prepare the soil well before planting. Mix manure, compost, or other organic matter into the first foot of soil in about equal volumes.<br/><br/>Artichokes don't reproduce true from seed, so they're best planted by using root divisions available at nurseries. Or a healthy plant can be dug up, the root divided into two or more parts and replanted. Artichoke plants reach a height of 3 or 4 feet and a spread of up to 6 feet in diameter, so allow plenty of space for them to grow. In the vegetable garden, plant them to the side so that they won't be disturbed by the more frequent planting of annual vegetables. They should be spaded at intervals of 4 to 6 feet along the row with 6 to 8 feet between the rows. In the ornamental garden, don't plant them near tree roots, as they don't compete well for nutrients and water.</br> The root sections should be set 6 to 8 inches deep in the soil.<br/><br/> Irrigate thoroughly before planting.",
    "arugula": "Growing Guide<br/><br/>Prefers rich humusy soil with pH of 6 to 6.8, but will tolerate wide variety of conditions. Evenly moist soil will help slow bolting.<br/> Growth is low and compact until heat causes plant to bolt. <br/> Forms a rosette of deeply lobed leaves. Plants become erect when heat induces bolting.<br/>Flowers are edible <br/><br/> MAINTAINING <br/>Seeds germinate quickly even in cold soil. Plant as soon as soil can be worked in spring.<br/>Avoid planting after other cabbage family crops.<br/> Plant ¼ inch deep and 1 inch apart in rows, or broadcast alone or mixed with other greens. Gradually thin to 6-inch spacings using thinnings for salads.<br/> Make new plantings every 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous supply until about a month before your average first frost date.",
    "asparagus": "Asparagus is a hardy perennial suited to USDA zones 2 to 8 and is native to western Europe. This perennial can remain viable for 10 to 20 years, so choose your garden site carefully. Asparagus needs a soil pH of between 7.0 and 7.2 in fertile, well-draining soil. <br/><br/> There’s no trick to growing asparagus from seeds, just be patient. It’s recommended that you start asparagus seeds indoors or in a greenhouse in mid-February to May under bright lighting. Soil temperatures for seed germination should be between 70 and 85 degrees F. (21-29 C.). Soak the seeds for a couple of hours, then plant each seed ½ inch (1 cm.) deep in sterile soil, in individual 2 inch (5 cm.) pots. They should sprout anywhere between two and eight weeks from planting asparagus seeds.",
    "basil": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Needs 6 at least 6 hours of sun per day. <br/> Prefers steady moisture and warm soil. <br/><br/> Maintaining <br/> Plant basil in fertile soil in a spot that gets direct sun for at least 6 hours per day. Pinch the tip from the center shoot of basil after it has grown for 6 weeks to force side growth and prevent early flowering. If flower stalks develop, simply snip them off. Basil needs a steady supply of moisture and warm soil temperatures to produce well, so you have to play a balancing act with mulch. In cool areas, delay mulching until the soil temperature has reached the mid-60s. Where summer really heats up and soil loses moisture quickly, you can add mulch sooner. <br/> Basil has few pests, but occasionally generalist pests such as aphids, flea beetles, and Japanese beetles will feast upon it. Rinse off aphids with a garden hose. To prevent beetles from munching, cover the crop with fabric row cover. If slugs are a problem on new transplants, try a barrier of copper flashing.",
    "beans": "Growing Guide<br/><br/> Beans generally do not respond well to transplanting, and are usually direct sown around or just after the last spring frost. The most important point about growing beans is not to plant them too early. They will rot in cool, damp soil. Even so, many beans require a long growing season of 80 days or more. To get an earlier start, you can put down black plastic, to warm the soil. <br/><br/> Most beans should be sown with the eye of the been facing downward, 1-2 inches deep, approximately 4 - 6 inches apart, with 24 inches or more between rows.The ideal site will be sunny, well - drained, moderately fertile, and slightly acidic(pH 6.0 - 7.0).Additionally, bean plants should be well - ventilated to promote proper development and deter mildew or mold that can trouble plants.Beans should not be grown in the same spot more than once every four years, and can be mutually beneficial with corn, strawberries and cucumber.Avoid planting beans near onion or fennel. <br/><br/> MAINTAINING BEANS <br/> When watering, try to avoid getting the leaves wet as this can promote fungus or other damaging conditions that beans can be susceptible to. Most types of beans are somewhat drought resistant, but check the surface of the soil frequently and water when the top layer has become dried out. <br/> <br/> Once established, beans generally will not require fertilizing and will generate their own nitrogen. However, if the leaves of young plants are pale this is an indication of nitrogen deficiency and starts can be fertilized with with fish emulsion or other natural nitrogen rich fertilizer.",
    "beets": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Prefers well-drained sandy loam to silt loam soil, high in organic matter, with pH between 6.5 and 7 and free of large stones. Good soil structure is important because growth is improved by good soil aeration. Beets grow poorly in acid soil. They tolerate low fertility but require consistent moisture. Do not plant in soils with pH less than 6.0. <br/><br/> MAINTAINING <br/> Plant in early spring, as soon as you can work the soil, ¾ inch deep and 1 inch apart in rows 12 to 18 inches apart. For continuous harvest, make successive plantings every three weeks until midsummer. For winter storage, sow crop about 10 weeks before heavy freeze. <br/><br/> The wrinkled “seedball” usually contains two to four viable seeds, making it necessary to thin to 3- to 4-inch spacings if you plan to harvest young, small or cylindrical-shaped roots, or 6-inch spacings for larger roots for winter storage.<br/> Begin thinning when seedlings are about 4 to 5 inches tall, and eat the thinnings. Cut rather than pull plants when thinning to avoid disturbing roots of other plants.",
    "bokchoy": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5. Can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. Needs plentiful, consistent moisture. <br/><br/>MAINTAINING<br/><br/> While not as sensitive to heat and cold as Chinese cabbage, spring crops may bolt prematurely if young plants are exposed to frost or a week of nighttime temperatures below 50 F. Wait until after last frost date to direct seed or transplant out. <br/><br/> Start transplants inside 4 to 6 weeks before last frost date. Transplant 6 to 12 inches apart in rows 18 to 30 inches apart. Use the closer spacings for smaller varieties. <br/> Plant direct-seeded spring crops ¼ to ½ inch deep and about 1 inch apart in rows 18 to 30 inches apart. Thin to 6- to 12-inch spacings. Use thinnings in salads <br/> For fall crops, direct seed ¼ to ½ inch deep in rows 18 to 30 inches apart in summer. Thin to 6- to 12- inch spacings. Or set transplants out at 6- to 12-inch spacings 4 to 6 weeks before first frost.",
    "broccoli": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Can tolerate light shade but will slow maturity. <br/> <br/> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5. Can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. Needs plentiful, consistent moisture. <br/> <br/> Broccoli prefers cool temperatures. In many regions it can be grown as both a spring and fall crop. Choose varieties touted for their abundant side shoots to extend the harvest; once the central head is harvested, these side shoots will continue to produce small heads for weeks. <br/> <br/> PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS <br/> Select a site with full sun and well-drained soil. Prepare the garden bed by using a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches, then mix in a 2 to 4-inch layer of compost. <br/> Start spring transplants indoors five to seven weeks before the last spring frost date, or buy nursery transplants three weeks before the last spring frost date. Where the weather is warm, select a variety that is bolt resistant. Set out transplants three to four weeks before the last spring frost. Space plants 18 inches apart. Protect transplants from hard frosts with newspapers, plastic cones, paper bags, or baskets. Provide a windbreak to reduce transplant shock and moisture loss. For fall crops, direct seed the broccoli in the garden 85 to 100 days before the average first fall frost date. <br/> <br/> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5. Can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. Needs plentiful, consistent moisture.<br/> <br/> MAINTAINING<br/><br/> Sow seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before average last spring frost. Keep soil warm (about 75 F), until germination. Then keep plants around 60 F. Provide direct sun so plants don’t get leggy. When plants are 4 to 6 weeks old, transplant into garden 12 to 20 inches apart. <br/>Can be direct-seeded as soon as you can work the soil. Will germinate at soil temps as low as 40 F. Plant ½ to ¾ inch deep, about 3 inches apart. Thin to final spacings. <br/> Direct seed in midsummer for fall crop, or start transplants in late May and transplant in late June or early July. Use low nitrogen fertilizer at planting. Too much nitrogen fertilizer may cause hollow stems.",
    "brussel": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5. Can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. Needs plentiful, consistent moisture. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/>Grow in summer for fall harvest, similar to a fall cabbage or broccoli crop.<br/> Direct seed about 4 months before expected fall frost. Plant seed 3 to 4 inches apart, ¼ to ½ inch deep in rows about 30 inches apart. Thin plants to about 18 inches apart. Start transplants in late May and transplant in late June or early July. Space plants 18 to 24 inches apart.",
    "cabbage": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Can tolerate light shade but will slow maturity. Light shade can be beneficial in warm weather. Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5. Can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. This heavy feeder also needs plentiful, consistent moisture. <br/><br/> MAINTAINING <br/> <br/> Sow seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before average last spring frost.Keep soil warm(about 75 F) until germination.Then keep plants around 60 F.Provide direct sun so plants don’t get leggy.When plants are 4 to 6 weeks old, transplants into garden 12 to 24 inches apart, in rows 18 to 34 inches apart.Use closer spacings for smaller, early varieties, wider spacings for larger, late- season varieties. Direct seed in summer for fall crop, or start transplants in late May and transplant in late June or early July. When cabbages are 4 to 5 inches tall, thin or transplant to stand 18 to 24 inches apart. Apply a thick layer of mulch to retain moisture. Water plants during the summer if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week. Contact your local county extension office for controls of common cabbage pests such as aphids, root maggots, cabbageworms, and cabbage loopers.",
    "carrot": "Growing Guide <br></br> Good quality roots require plentiful moisture and soil that is deep, loose, free of stones, and high in organic matter. Roots can become twisted and forked in heavy, stony soil. Prefers pH of 6.0 to 6.8 but can tolerate 5.5 to 7.5. Requires only moderate nitrogen. Too much can cause root branching. <br/><br/> MAINTAINING <br/> Plant in spring, 2 to 3 weeks before last frost, ½ inch deep, ½ inch apart, in rows 12 to 24 inches apart. Deeply worked soil with fine, weed-free seedbed will greatly improve chances of successful crop. <br/> Carrots are slow to germinate (1 to 3 weeks), and often germinate unevenly over a period of several weeks. To speed germination, water lightly daily if soil is dry. <br/> <br/> Thinning is critical to reduce competition from neighboring plants. Thin to 1- to 4-inch spacings (depending on size of root desired) before plants are 2 inches tall. Cutting rather than pulling reduces disturbance of the remaining plants. Use seed tape or pelleted seed for more even spacings and less thinning. Or mix seed in roughly equal proportions with sand, fine vermiculite, or dried coffee grounds. Mulch to keep soil cool, conserve moisture and to keep exposed shoulders from turning green and bitter. Another option is to hill soil over the shoulders.",
    "cauliflower": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Can tolerate light shade but will slow maturity. <br/> <br/> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter, pH 6.0 to 7.5.

    "celery": "Growing Guide <br/> <br/> Prefers rich soil, high in organic matter with pH 6.0 to 7.0 and consistent, plentiful supply of moisture. Can tolerate soils that are less than well-drained because it was originally a wetland plant. Seeds need to be started inside and are difficult to germinate.Cold weather after transplanting can cause bolting.Needs plentiful moisture and long season, but doesn't tolerate heat well. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/> Start plants inside about 10 to 12 weeks before last frost. Plant several seeds per cell. Seeds need light to germinate, so don't cover seed deeply. Keep soil moist and warm (about 70 F to 75 F) until seeds germinate in 2 to 3 weeks. After germination, grow inside in a cool location (about 60 F to 70 F). Thin to one seed per cell. Plants will withstand light frost, but 10 days with night temperatures below 40 and days below 55 F can cause bolting.So harden plants by reducing water, not lowering temperature. Set out transplants 6 to 12 inches apart, rows 18 to 36 inches apart, about 2 weeks before average last frost.",
    "chard": "Growing Guide <br/> <br/> Prefers full sun early in the season, part shade in summer when it’s warm. Prefers full sun early in the season, part shade in summer when it’s warm. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/> Start planting about 2 to 3 weeks before last expected frost. Sow seeds ½ to 1 inch deep, 2 to 6 inches apart, in rows 18 to 24 apart. Like beets, chard “seeds” produce more than one plant, and so will require thinning. Thin to 6- to 12-inch spacings. If you plan to harvest whole plants, make succession plantings through late summer. Delay planting of ‘Ruby Red’ or ‘Rhubarb’ chard until after last frost.These varieties may go to seed(bolt) if seed is exposed to freezing temperatures. Start seed inside for earlier crops, or if you want to arrange different colored plants of the variety ‘Bright Lights.’ Mulch plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. You can begin harvesting when leaves reach usable size.Remove a leaf or two from each plant, or cut plants an inch or two above the soil for cut - and - come - again harvest.Avoid damaging the growing point in the center of the plant at harvest.",
    "cilantro": "Growing Guide <br/> <br/> Plant coriander in full sun; it will tolerate light shade.Coriander grows best in well - drained but moisture- retentive soil rich in organic matter.Prepare planting beds in advance with aged compost.Coriander prefers a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.7. Sow coriander seed ¼ to ½ inch deep; thin successful seedlings from 8 to 12 inches apart.Space rows 12 to 15 inches apart. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/> Keep coriander evenly moist throughout the growing season.Do not let plants dry out.Avoid overhead watering as plants reach maturity; overhead water or rain can reduce seed yield.Add aged compost to the planting bed in advance of planting.Do not fertilize at midseason.",
    "corn": "Growing Guide <br/><br/> Needs deep, well - drained, fertile soil, pH 6.0 to 6.8 and consistent, plentiful moisture. Tender annual Requires excellent soil and consistent moisture. Otherwise, it's not difficult to grow. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/><br/> Corn requires rich, fertile soil.Add compost or well rotted manure in fall.Consider planting a legume cover crop the season before corn to help meet the nutrient needs of this heavy feeder. Make first planting after last frost date.Soil should be at least 65 F for fast germination. (Corn will not germinate if soil temperature is less than 55 F.) To speed increase in soil temperature, consider covering soil with black plastic for several weeks before planting. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows of a single hybrid(as opposed to fewer, longer rows) for good pollination and well- filled ears. Some corn varieties need to be isolated from others.See variety information below. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart.Thin to 8 - to 12 - inch spacings when plants are 3 to 4 inches tall.Increase seeding rates to ensure a good stand if soils are cold or you are using seed that has not been treated with fungicide. Untreated seed has natural color.Treated seed is dyed. For a sequential harvest, make first planting using an early hybrid.Two weeks later, plant another block of an early hybrid, plus blocks of mid - and late - season hybrids.Continue making plantings until late June or early July, depending on the length of your growing season. To save space, you can intercrop corn with early - harvested cool - season crops. Corn plants have many roots close to the surface, so cultivate around them with care.You can hill soil up around the base of plants as they grow to bury small weeds in the row and give the corn a better foothold.After the soil has warmed, you can mulch corn to help suppress weeds and retain moisture. It is not necessary to remove suckers(side sprouts growing from the base of the plant).Studies show that removing them may actually reduce yields. Corn is a heavy feeder - particularly of nitrogen - and may require several sidedressings of fertilizer for best yields.Look for signs of nutrient deficiency.Purple - tinged leaves are a sign of phosphorus deficiency.Pale green leaves are a sign of nitrogen deficiency. For miniature or baby corn, plant seeds 2 to 4 inches apart and harvest as silks emerge from the ear, or harvest secondary ears from normally spaced plantings, allowing the main ear to fully mature.Also try hybrids specifically bred for early baby corn harvest.",
    "cucumber": "Growing Guide <br/> <br/> Well - drained, fertile soil, high in organic matter with near - neutral pH.Consistent, plentiful moisture needed until fruit is ripening.May develop bitter taste in dry sites.Cucumbers are heavy nitrogen feeders and require fertile soil. Cucumbers are not hard to grow if you provide good soil, plenty of moisture and full sun, wait for soil and weather to warm before planting, and use fabric row covers if pests are a problem. Vining varieties can climb up to 6 feet with support, or hug the ground if allowed to sprawl. Bush varieties take up only 2 or 3 square feet, while unsupported vining varieties can run along the ground for 6 or more feet. <br/> <br/> MAINTAINING <br/><br/> Cucumbers are very sensitive to cold.They need warm soil and air, whether direct- seeded or transplanted.Don’t rush to plant too early.Seed will not germinate if soil temperature is below 50 F, and germinates only slowly at 68 F. Direct - seed 1 to 1 ½ inches deep, either in rows(2 inches apart in rows 5 to 6 feet apart or in hills 3 to 6 seeds per hill, hills spaced 3 to 5 feet apart. Thin to 8 to 15 inches apart in rows or 2 to 3 plants per hill.Snip off plants when thinning to avoid disturbing the roots of nearby plants. For early crops, use black plastic mulch and row covers or other protection to speed warming and protect plants.Direct seed into holes in plastic.Cucumbers seeded into black plastic usually produce larger yields, as well earlier ones. For extra early crops, start plants inside 3 to 5 weeks before transplanting.Sow 3 seeds per pot in 2 - inch pots.Thin to one or two plants per pot.Grow above 70 F during the day and above 60 F at night.Be careful when hardening - off plants not to expose them to cold temperatures. Plants with one or two true leaves transplant best.Transplant into black plastic mulch or warm garden soil after danger of frost has passed and weather has settled.Be careful not to damage roots when transplanting.If using peat pots, make sure they are saturated before transplanting and completely buried.If using row covers, remove when flowers begin to blossom to assure good pollination. For a continuous harvest, make successive plantings every 2 to 3 weeks until about 3 months before first fall frost date.About 1 month before first frost, start pinching off new flowers so plants channel energy into ripening existing fruit. To save space, train vining cucumbers to a trellis. (Make sure the trellised plants don’t shade other sun - loving plants.) This also increases air circulation(reducing disease problems), makes harvest easier and produces straighter fruit.Set up trellis before planting or transplanting to avoid root injury.Space plants about 10 inches apart.Pinch back vines that extend beyond the trellis to encourage lateral growth. Most cucumbers have both male and female flowers.The male flowers blossom first and produce pollen, but no fruit.Other varieties produce female flowers predominately or exclusively.Seed packs of these varieties include a few seeds(usually marked with dye) of another variety that produces male flowers to provide pollen.Make sure you don’t remove pollinator plants when thinning. Cucumbers are heavy feeders and require fertile soil, nitrogen fertilizer, and / or additions of high - N organic matter sources.Pale, yellowish leaves indicate nitrogen deficiency.Leaf bronzing is a sign of potassium deficiency.",
//     "eggplant": "Growing Guide
// GROWING NOTES
// Prefers fertile, well- drained, slightly acid soil that is high in organic matter for best growth and yield, but tolerates a broader range of soil types.Has moderate moisture needs.

// Tender annual.

// Requires fertile soil and a long, warm growing season.

// Relatively inconspicuous, curling down and hidden within foliage.

//     MAINTAINING
// Start inside about 6 weeks before last frost date(or about 8 weeks before expected transplanting).Plant 1 / 4 inch deep in flats or cell - type containers.Keep soil warm(about 80 F to 90 F if possible) until emergence.Eggplant will not germinate in cool soil.

// Harden off plants carefully before transplanting by reducing temperature and water.

// Wait until weather has settled, all chance of frost has passed and soil is in the 60s F before transplanting, perhaps 2 to 3 weeks after the average last frost date.Cool conditions can weaken plants.Frost will kill them.

// Consider using raised beds or black plastic mulch to warm soil and speed early - season growth.If using organic mulches to help retain moisture, do not apply until the soil has warmed.

// Set transplants 18 to 24 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart.

// Use row covers to protect plants from pests.

// If season is cool, fruit set may be inconsistent.Plants with heavy fruit set benefit from staking.

// Eggplants are heavy feeders, but avoid high - nitrogen fertilizers.They may encourage lush foliage growth at the expense of fruit.

// Pinch off blossoms 2 to 4 weeks before first expected frost so that plants channel energy into ripening existing fruit, not producing new ones.

// To help reduce disease, do not plant eggplants or other tomato - family crops in the same location more than once every three or four years.
